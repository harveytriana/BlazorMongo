*A generic and optimized implementation to consume a mongoDB data service in Blazor.*

MongoDB is a document database that offers great scalability and flexibility. Great performance and high performance both in the cloud and locally.

In this document I show the practical and generic strategy to implement a mongoDB service in a Blazor application. It is remarkable how Blazor flows and in turn we have a clean, powerful and scalable code.

> *It is worth clarifying that this document was not written as a tutorial. You can study the code in post on GitHub (references).*
